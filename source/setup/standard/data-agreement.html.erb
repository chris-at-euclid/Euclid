			<p><b>1.

			<p><b>5.	Data Collection.</b>  The Wireless Access Points are used by Euclid to identify wireless devices that publicly transmit signals within a distance of approximately sixty (60) meters of the Wireless Access Point.  If Your customer has a Wi-Fi-equipped mobile device and Wi-Fi is turned on, the Wireless Access Point senses the following: the presence of the mobile device, its Media Access Control (MAC) address, the mobile device’s manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, etc.), its signal strength, and, if the device is currently connected to a Wi-Fi network, the name of that network. No personal information is collected or used. Real-world identity is not collected or used by Euclid. Euclid then aggregates these data into reports for its clients.</p>
			<p>The above pieces of information that are collected from the Wireless Access Points are referred to herein collectively as the “Data.”  You understand and agree that Data collected and/or used by Euclid will not be made available to You, and that all Data collected by the Wireless Access Point(s) shall remain the property of Euclid, which it may retain and use subject to this Data Agreement, and may be used following the expiration or termination of this Data Agreement.</p>
