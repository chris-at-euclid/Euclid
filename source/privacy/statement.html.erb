  			A Statement on Privacy
  		</h1>
  		<div class="col9"> 
  			<span class="sectionlabel">Overview</span>
  			<p>We are a team of software engineers, data scientists, product managers, and entrepreneurs. We are also regular people: moms, dads, former retailers, and full-time consumers. We design privacy into our product from the very beginning. To do that, we follow three principles:</p>
  			<ul>
  				<li><b>No personal information is collected or used</b></li>
  				<li><b>We only use aggregate, anonymous information</b></li>
  				<li><b>Anyone can opt out</b></li>
  			</ul>
  			<p>If you have any questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@euclidanalytics.com">privacy@euclidanalytics.com</a>.</p>
  			<span class="sectionlabel">What exactly do we collect and why?</span>
  			<p>If you have a Wi-Fi-equipped phone and Wi-Fi is turned on, Euclid senses the following: the presence of the phone, its Media Access Control (MAC) address, the phone’s manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, etc.), its signal strength, and, if the device is currently connected to a Wi-Fi network, the name of that network. Euclid then anonymizes and aggregates these data into reports for retail clients. The reports are used by our retail clients to do things like improve store layouts, determine timing for promotions and sales, and set staffing levels and store hours.</p>

  			<span class="sectionlabel">How does Euclid collect information? </span>
  			<p>When any Wi-Fi-enabled mobile device is turned on, it regularly sends “shout-outs” to nearby wireless networks that say the equivalent of “Hello, world!” All phones, computers, and other Wi-Fi-enabled mobile devices send these shout-outs to introduce themselves to Wi-Fi networks. Included in each shout-out is a unique identifier called a MAC address. This combination of numbers and letters identifies a specific mobile device to the surrounding Wi-Fi networks. The MAC address does not contain the real-world identify the user nor does it contain any personally identifiable information. You can find more information about MAC addresses on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">Wikipedia</a> or feel free to <a href="mailto:privacy@euclidanalytics.com">contact us</a>.</p>
        <p>Euclid can sense when Wi-Fi-enabled devices make a shout-out. Euclid saves the information embedded in the shout-out, makes it secure by scrambling or encrypting it, then transmits the data to a database. The data in the database is used to produce reports -- aggregated and anonymous -- for our retail clients. They use these reports to improve store layouts, set the timing of promotions and sales, measure the effect of advertising, and determine store staffing and open hours.</p>
        <p>Euclid's software was specially written to limit the sensor’s data collection to only what we need to provide the Euclid Services. At no point is your name, phone number or any personally identifiable information – other than what is described explicitly in this statement – collected by Euclid.</p>

  			<span class="sectionlabel">If Euclid's data do not contain names or other personal information, how is it useful?</span>
  			<p>Our clients use Euclid to answer questions like: How many new shoppers did I have today? Last week? Do more people stop and enter the store with one window display vs. another? Did my marketing campaign work?</p>
			<p>Answering these questions does not require personal information of any kind. We only need to determine the amount of traffic that came into the store.</p>

  			<span class="sectionlabel">With whom does Euclid share information?</span>
        <p>We share anonymous, aggregate analysis as described in this statement with our clients -- the retailers in whose stores the anonymous foot-traffic data is captured.</p>
		
		<p>Euclid does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose any device-level information to third parties. When Euclid publishes aggregate, anonymous analysis of retail traffic trends to third parties, these never include device-level data or the identity of the stores included in the analysis. By definition, none of Euclid's information contains personally identifiable information or real-world identities of shoppers because we do not collect or use such data.</p>
		
		<p>We only use qualified, respected 3rd-party providers (such as Amazon Web Services) for data exchange, aggregation, and storage, which are necessary to provide Euclid's services. Read more about <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/security/">Amazon’s security measures</a>.</p>
        
  			<span class="sectionlabel">How does Euclid store data?</span>
  			<p>Data is transferred securely (using SSL) and is anonymized (hashed) before it is stored on Amazon Web Services. Hashed data can not be “reverse engineered” to reveal a device’s MAC address.</p>
        <p><i>This means that anyone who gains access to the database directly from Amazon – authorized or unauthorized – will only see long strings of numbers and letters and would not be able to get any information that could be linked to a back to a mobile device owner.</i></p>

  			<span class="sectionlabel">Can Euclid link a device and the stored data to a real-world identity?</span>
  			<p>No. The only way that could happen is if a user tells Euclid their real-world identity. And we never ask for, collect, or use real-world identity.</p>
			
			<span class="sectionlabel">How does Euclid work with governments and law enforcement?</span>
			<p>We respond to requests from government agencies or law enforcement to the extent required by law. We disclose information pursuant to subpoenas or court orders or other requests if we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law.</p>

  			<span class="sectionlabel">Can anyone opt out and delete the data Euclid has about a particular MAC address?</span>
  			<p>Yes. Anyone can opt out by <%= link_to_signupsite('optout', 'submitting your MAC address here', '') %>. Within seven days, Euclid will remove existing data about that MAC address and will not collect data about it in the future. If you have any comments or questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@euclidanalytics.com">privacy@euclidanalytics.com</a>. Our <%= link_to 'website privacy statement', '/site-privacy.html' %> has information specific to euclidanalytics.com (which is entirely distinct from our analytics service offering).</p>
			<p>Thank you.</p> <p><b>The Euclid Team</b></p>
