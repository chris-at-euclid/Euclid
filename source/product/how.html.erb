	  			<div class="sectionlabel">Shopper with smartphone approaches your store</div>
				<p>Euclid Analytics measures the behavior of all your shoppers that are carrying a Wi-Fi enabled smartphone. Typically, this is 40-70% of your shoppers, depending on the business and location.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="sectionlabel">Smartphone broadcasts Wi-Fi pings</div>
				<p>Smartphones constantly send out short "pings" as they search for Wi-Fi networks nearby. These pings include the phone's MAC address (a unique identifier associated with a specific device) and other non-personal information like signal strength that we use to determine rough location.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="sectionlabel">Euclid records Wi-Fi pings and sends them to the cloud</div>
				<p>Using your existing Wi-Fi infrastructure or our compact plug-and-play sensor, we record pings and send them to the cloud. For privacy, we scramble each MAC address using a one-way hashing algorithm. Because shoppers don't need to actually connect to your Wi-Fi network or install a mobile app, you can measure their activity without interrupting their shopping experience. </p>

				<div class="sectionlabel how-section">Euclid processes and stores data</div>
				<p>Our advanced heuristics extract actionable insights from the data and store them in Amazon's highly secure datacenters.</p>
