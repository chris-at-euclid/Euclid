					Euclid Analytics uses small sensors to measure Wi-Fi “pings” that are broadcast by Wi-Fi enabled phones as they search for available networks. The phone does not actually need to be connected to a Wi-Fi network; it merely needs to be open to the idea. Our advanced heuristics use several different factors – including signal strength, ping frequency, and proximity to our sensors – to determine the approximate location of each phone.

	  				Each Euclid sensor is about the size of a deck of cards, installs in two minutes, and can cover up to 100,000 sq. ft. If you have existing Wi-Fi infrastructure from Aruba, Aerohive or Xirrus, you already have everything you need - your Wi-Fi access points can act as Euclid sensors. Because shoppers do not need to use your in-store Wi-Fi or install a mobile app, you can measure a large sample of your customers without interrupting their shopping experience.

	  				The exact percentage of shoppers that will be measured depends a lot on the location of your store and the kinds of customers it attracts. Typically, we find that 40%-70% of all visitors are carrying a phone we can measure (Wi-Fi equipped and enabled). These figures are consistent with recent third-party research – in June 2012, Nielsen reported that 54.9% of US mobile subscribers already own a smartphone. Since smartphones now represent 2 out of 3 mobile phone purchases, the percentage of shoppers you can measure will only continue to grow.
