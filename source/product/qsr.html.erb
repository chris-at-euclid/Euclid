		  		<li><b>Should I extend my business hours?</b><br/><br/>The Walkby metric tells you how many people pass by the store after hours, so you can see if youâ€™re missing out on potential business.
</li>
		  		<li><b>Did my ad campaign really increase store traffic?</b><br/><br/> With Outside Traffic and Window Conversion metrics, you can judge whether your actions made a difference.
</li>
		  		<li><b>How loyal are my existing customers?</b><br/><br/>Use the distribution of Visit Frequency and Visit Recency to segment your customers.
