          <h1>Euclid's U.S. Retail Benchmarks</h1>
          <p class="large-text">August 2013</p>
		  <p>SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- September 4, 2013 -- Euclid Analytics, the leader in in-store retail analytics, today released its U.S. Retail Benchmarks for August 2013. With data on 20 million domestic shopping sessions during the month, Euclid finds that, while walk-by conversion slipped versus July, Back-to-School and some lingering seasonal clearance drove strong improvements in bounce rate, and visit duration. We believe that these metrics bode well for specialty retailers' comp store and total store sales during the month.

	  				<p>The percentage of shoppers who entered a store but left within five minutes ("bounce rate") was 14.1% in August 2013, down from 15.5% in August 2012. This is on top of July 2013's 250 bps improvement versus LY (19.5% in July 2012 vs. 17.0% in July 2013). Continued improvement on in-store engagement is a positive sign for both comp store and total store sales during the period. The net effect of conversion and engagement rates is to be determined. The engagement numbers are particularly good indicator of successful Back-to-School merchandising and marketing in specialty retail.</p>

          <h1>Euclid's U.S. Retail Benchmarks</h1>
          <p class="large-text">July 2013</p>
		  <p>SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- August 7, 2013 -- Euclid Analytics, the leader in in-store retail analytics, today released its U.S. Retail Benchmarks for July 2013.  With data on 20 million domestic shopping sessions during the month, Euclid finds that increases in walk-by conversion and visit duration, coupled with a decline in bounce rate, offered speciality and large-format U.S. retailers prime opportunity to increase comp and total store sales during the month.</p>

	  				<p>Walk-by conversion, defined as the number of shoppers who enter a store as a percentage of the total walk-by foot traffic, in July 2013 increased to 17.9% from 15.2% in June 2013 and 16.0% in May 2013.  Seasonal shifts in traffic and promotional activity — particularly in specialty retail — in the month of July appear to have driven the substantive increase.  Year-ago data is not currently available.</p>
