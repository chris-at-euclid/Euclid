          <h1>Euclid's U.S. Retail Benchmarks</h1>
          <p class="large-text">February 2014</p>
		  <p>SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- March 6, 2014 -- Euclid, the leader of in-store retail analytics, today released its U.S. Retail Benchmarks for February 2014. Euclid's data on tens of millions of domestic shopping sessions during February revealed that shopper activity cooled off in February as a result of extremely cold weather across the country. Shopper traffic dipped significantly and fewer repeat visits were experienced as consumers stayed out of the cold. Bounce rates were significantly higher than last year as a result of quicker, more targeted visits. We believe that these metrics illustrate a weak outlook for retail sales during the month.

	  				<div class="content-list-item-title sectionlabel" style="color:#4b9a06;margin:3px 0 10px 0">INCREASED 0.7% YEAR-OVER-YEAR</div>
	  				<p>For February, Euclid estimates that GAFO retail sales increased a modest 0.7% compared to last year. The month saw very weak traffic as a result of the weather, acting as a significant inhibitor to sales. Bounce rates were up year-over-year and overall average shopping session duration improved marginally, likely having a neutral to slightly-negative impact to sales. Shoppers’ desire to buy was further hampered by a weak economic outlook, with consumer confidence sagging in February. As a result of these factors, sales growth was weak in February and not greatly improved from January.</p>

	  				<p>Traffic in January decreased 17.6% compared to the previous month, but increased 1.4% compared to the same month last year. Shopping visits grew despite harsh winter storms across much of the country this year. Shoppers appeared intent to take advantage of less crowded malls after the holidays and compelling end-of-season deals in January. Traffic was particularly benefited from strong weekends at the beginning of the month and around the Martin Luther King holiday.</p>

	  				<div class="content-list-item-title sectionlabel" style="color:#4b9a06;margin:3px 0 10px 0">INCREASED 1% YEAR-OVER-YEAR</div>
	  				<p>Storefront conversion in February, defined as the number of shoppers who enter a store as a percentage of the total foot traffic, rose to 8.4% from 7.6% last year, remaining flat from January levels. Keeping with recent trends, this February was significantly more promotional than last year, and storefront conversion appeared to be positively impacted, as last February conversion rates were near the lowest of the year. In addition, the depression of activity outside this year also contributed to higher storefront conversion rates.</p>

	  				<div class="content-list-item-title sectionlabel" style="color:#DEB100;margin:3px 0 10px 0">INCREASED 2% YEAR-OVER-YEAR</div>
	  				<p>The percentage of shoppers who entered a store but left within five minutes ("bounce rate") was 10.4% in February 2014, up significantly from 8.3% experienced in February of last year, but showing slight improvement from 10.7% seen in January. The rise in bounce rates is likely also a result of cold weather as lengthy shopping visits were less of a priority. Many shopping trips were quick and focused, but this is not necessarily a major concern in light of the positive movement in overall shopping session duration.</p>

	  				<p>Shopping session duration, defined as the mean time from store entry to store exit, was 22.7 minutes in February, an increase from 22.5 minutes last year, but a decrease from the 23.0 last month. Average duration remained strong in the heavily promotional environment. Retailers did well to keep shoppers engaged in the store in a month that usually sees less interest in robust browsing from shoppers.</p>

	  				<p>In February, active repeat customers, defined as individuals returning to a store location more than once in 30 days, totaled 11.5% of total visits measured, a significant decline from 13.8% in January and 14.6% seen last February. The repeat ratio declined for the first time since September 2013 after five consecutive months of increases. This trend of depressed repeat shopping trips is emblematic of consumers’ efforts to keep nonessential trips to a minimum during spells of cold weather.</p>

	  				<p>The best day of the month was Monday February 24th, with the February’s best engagement level. Strong duration outperformance was seen on this day as the majority of shoppers made lengthy, full visits. The engagement level is particularly impressive in light of the high traffic that was seen on that day. The worst day of the month was Wednesday the 19th, which saw a significant slowdown in activity following the long President’s Day holiday weekend. This day saw underperformance across all of our metrics compared to other Wednesdays in the month and last year. This day was plagued by particularly low storefront conversion and a high bounce rate. </p>

	  			  <h3>Valentine's Day</h3>
	  				<p>Valentine’s Day did not have nearly the positive impact on shopping activity this year as it had last year. Cold, stormy weather and the growing ease of online fulfillment caused an increasing amount of Valentine’s Day related shopping to shift online and away from the physical store. During the week leading up to the holiday, traffic was down more than 10% and storefront conversion rates were flat. However, heavy promotions and successful merchandising did appear to drive engaged visits for those who did come to the store, with duration up nearly 4%. Shoppers were still keen to maximize the bang for their buck and responded well to deals.</p>

          <p class="large-text">January 2014</p>
		  <p>SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- February 5, 2014 -- Euclid, the leader of in-store retail analytics, today released its U.S. Retail Benchmarks for January 2014. Euclid's data on nearly 25 million domestic shopping sessions during the month revealed that shoppers remained quite active in January despite the effects of bad winter weather across much of the country. Shopper traffic and storefront conversion showed improvement over last year for another month in a row as shoppers looked to capitalize on a very promotional January. Average visit durations rebounded to five-month highs as shoppers returned to healthier browsing behavior after the rushed holiday season. Despite some of the expected headwinds, we believe that these metrics illustrate a positive outlook for retailers' comp store sales during the month.

This was a slight decline from the 8.9% seen in December 2013. The trend of highly aggressive promotions continued in January and once again appeared to positively impact Storefront conversion as value-conscious shoppers were more successfully attracted into the store than last year.

	  				<p>The percentage of shoppers who entered a store but left within five minutes ("bounce rate") was 10.7% in January 2014, up from 10.3% experienced in both the previous month and January of last year. Bounce rates rose again in January after showing improvement last month, likely the result an increased percentage of shopping trips that were related to returns, exchanges, and gift card redemptions this January.

	  				<p>Shopping session duration, defined as the mean time from store entry to store exit, was 23.0 minutes in January, an increase from 22.0 minutes last year and 22.2 last month. Average duration was as long as it has been since August 2013, showing shoppers were browsing more merchandise and felt less pressured to get in and out of the store in a hurry, likely having a positive impact on average sales. The magnitude of the improvement over last year is a positive sign that shoppers were looking to spend with the surplus of store credit and gift card value generated by the holidays.   </p>

In addition, shoppers were very engaged in-store with one of the lowest bounce rates of the month. This day saw a lot of shoppers looking to take advantage of great post-holiday deals. The worst day of the month was Monday the 6th, which was negatively impacted by weather and a likely shopper hangover following the holidays. This day saw worse performance across all of our metrics than any other Monday during the month. Engagement was particularly poor, with one of the highest bounce rates seen in the month. </p>

	  			  <h3>2013 Holiday Season Recap</h3>
	  				<p>We are maintaining our expectation that final holiday sales will increase compared to last year. Overall traffic was more robust than expected, rising year-over-year despite the shortened holiday period as attractive in-store deals drew shoppers out of their homes. However, traffic was very volatile week to week, driven by inconsistent weather and periods of particularly heavy promotions. Window conversion increased compared to last year as each trip to the mall became more focused. As expected, bounce rates continued to rise and overall visit durations shrank as shoppers were pressed for time and had less interest in extensive browsing. A decline in active repeat customers compared to last year was also seen as a result of the fewer trips to store locations. We believe that in the face of challenges including unfavorable weather and a shortened shopping season, the retailers that fared the best this holiday were the ones that invested in their omni-channel capabilities to win the competition for consumers’ attention.</p>

          <h1>Euclid's U.S. Retail Benchmarks</h1>
          <p class="large-text">November 2013</p>
		  <p>SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- December 10, 2013 -- Euclid, the leader of in-store retail analytics, today released its U.S. Retail Benchmarks for November 2013. Euclid’s data on nearly 25 million domestic shopping sessions during the month shows that that shopper traffic and window conversion improved significantly as heavy promotions brought shoppers back out to the mall. Average visit durations were shorter than a year ago for the fourth month in a row as the increasingly omni-channel marketplace continued to drive more focused shopping trips. Although, calendar shifts will be a headwind to comps, we believe these metrics bode well for retailers’ sales in November.

	  				<p>Traffic in November, defined as the number of devices detected by Euclid sensors at retail locations, increased 32.2% compared to the previous month and 20.0% compared to the same month last year. Shopping visits rebounded significantly after a depressed October, driven by heavy promotions that started earlier than usual and a strong Black Friday weekend with deals spread out across multiple days.</p>

Retailers’ early and widespread promotions during the month were successful at compelling value-conscious shoppers to make the trip to brick-and-mortar locations, with window conversion reaching a high for the year.</p>

Despite the incremental improvement in November, durations are shorter than last year for yet another month as shoppers remain very deliberate with their trips to the store.

	  				<p>Deep discounts, highly attractive promotions and extended open hours successfully brought shoppers to brick-and-mortar locations during Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday this year, with traffic up 1.9% compared to the same two day period last year. Looking at Black Friday itself, traffic was actually down YoY as the early start to deals on Thursday pulled many shopping trips forward. Window conversion was up 2.3% YoY for the two day period as well, nearly reaching 10% on Black Friday, as enticing deals brought crowds through the door. Counter to recent trends, average visit duration jumped 5.6% YoY to 24.4 minutes on Black Friday as shoppers were willing to endure busy floors and long lines to capitalize on hot offers. However, longer duration did not necessarily translate into larger average sales. Overall, shopper behavior over the weekend showed positive signs for retail sales, and reflected a strong start to the holidays.</p>

		  <p>SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- November 14, 2013 -- Euclid, the leader of in-store retail analytics, today released its U.S. Retail Benchmarks for October 2013. Euclid’s data on nearly 20 million domestic shopping sessions during the month shows that shopper traffic and intent continued to suffer in the face of the 16 day government shutdown. Positive signs came from improvement in window conversion as some shoppers were enticed by aggressive promotions. We believe that these metrics are indicative of continued volatility for retailers' comp store and total store sales during the month.

However, the bounce rate has declined slightly from September’s high of 11.1%.

	  			  <h3>Euclid Holiday Forecasts</h3>
	  				<p>We expect holiday sales to rise compared to last year, driven by increased disposable income, a very promotional holiday, and pent up demand from several weeks of depressed spending. Having said this, Euclid predicts that overall traffic will drop year-over-year as the shortened holiday period and continued economic uncertainty result in more focused shopping. Bounce rates will continue to rise and overall visit durations will shrink as shoppers, pressed for time, have less patience for longer lines and less interest in extensive browsing. We also expect a decline in repeat customers compared to last year as a result of the fewer trips to store locations. To respond, retailers looking to attract these shoppers need to focus on more aggressive up-front promotions, stronger in-store visual, heavier staffing during peak periods, and keen attention to out-of-stock events.   </p>
